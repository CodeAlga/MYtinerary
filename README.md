This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# MYtineray by CodeAlga

A Progressive Web Application built in the MERN Stack and looking sharp with Material UI.
The MVP of the project was to create an app that displayed tours of cities for visitors to do. The should have a bit of infor regarding the time and money needed to invest in said tours.
But this tours are not created by a company, they are created by the people that live and walk and know the city.

Casual users (without an account) shoud be able to navigate the cities and the tours and see the info regarding each itinerary.
For registered users it was required registration (duh!) and access to extra features like beeing able to have favourites and leave comments the existing tours. In order for them to be able to do that a custom middleware existis with a JWT security sistem that ensures users that are logged in can operate fully throught the app.

Other addons like bcrypt, multer, slick-carousel and more third-party npm packages have been used to create this app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
